# Sovereign Auth Guide

**Code patterns for making `@azure/identity` work with Azure Stack Hub, Azure Government Secret, and Azure Government Top Secret.**

This guide shows the specific code changes needed to authenticate with the Azure SDKs in private cloud environments — where Microsoft's public instance discovery endpoints are unreachable and custom authority hosts, ARM endpoints, and token audiences must be configured explicitly.

---

## Who this is for

- Engineers building apps for **Azure Government Secret (IL6)** or **Top Secret (TS/SCI)** enclaves
- Teams deploying to **Azure Stack Hub** with custom authority hosts and ARM endpoints
- Anyone working with **custom Azure clouds** where `login.microsoftonline.com` is not accessible

## The core problem

The `@azure/identity` SDK validates authority hosts against Microsoft's public instance discovery endpoint by default. In air-gapped or private clouds, this validation fails because:

1. The authority host (e.g., `login.mystack.contoso.local`) is **not registered** with Microsoft's public directory
2. The network **cannot reach** `login.microsoft.com` to perform the validation
3. The ARM audience and service endpoints **differ** from public cloud defaults

## The solution

Set `disableInstanceDiscovery: true` on credential constructors and provide explicit cloud configuration — authority hosts, ARM endpoints, token audiences, and service DNS suffixes — through a **cloud profile** that encapsulates all environment-specific values.

This reference app demonstrates the complete pattern with a working implementation.

## Where developers usually get stuck

Teams new to Azure Air-Gap clouds usually need more than the one-line `disableInstanceDiscovery` fix. They also need to know:

- **Which values come from the cloud operator** — authority host, ARM endpoint, ARM audience, DNS suffixes, and tenant IDs
- **Which credential types need special handling** — `ClientSecretCredential`, `WorkloadIdentityCredential`, and `DeviceCodeCredential` do; `ManagedIdentityCredential` and `AzureCliCredential` do not
- **How to tell endpoint, audience, and scope apart** — the ARM REST base URL, token audience, and `/.default` scope are related but not interchangeable
- **How to validate a cloud profile before writing app code** — resolve the profile, inspect `/api/profile`, and run the smoke test before debugging token failures
- **What is placeholder data vs. deployable data** — the Secret, Top Secret, and Azure Stack built-in profiles are templates and must be replaced with environment-specific values
